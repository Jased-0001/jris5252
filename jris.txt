Registers
0x10: LDA - Load A
0x11: LDB - Load B
0x12: LDC - Load C
0x13: SAB - Switch A and B
0x14: SBC - Switch B and C
0x15: SAC - Switch A and C

Math
0x20: ADD - A = A + B
0x21: SUB - A = A - B
0x22: MUL - A = A * B
0x23: GRT - C is 0x00 if A is greater than B
0x24: EAQ - C is 0x00 if A is equal to B

I/O
0xE0: PRN - Print character value of A
0xE1: GET - Get one character and put it in A

Conditional and Unconditional Jumps
0xE2: JMP - Jump no matter what
0xE3: JNZ - Jump if C is zero (use with GRT and EAQ)
0xE4: JTA - Jump to A register
0xE5: JTB - Jump to B register

Memory
0xEB: WMEM - Write Memory (regiser A is data, B is addr)
0xEC: RMEM - Read Memory (register A is data, B is addr)

Other
0xEA: NOP - No Operation
0xFD: DEB - Debug (print registers and memory)
0xFF: HLT - Stop execution and shut down
